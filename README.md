# Office Status Widget

In this project AJAX is used to fetch the data from JSON. It shows status of the employees which are in and out of the office. It displays which meetings rooms are available and which are not.

AJAX- Asynchronous Javascript and XML - It helps in loading HTML page without loading a web page.

AJAX can be performed in these steps-

1- Creating XMLHttpRequestObject

Example - var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

2- Creating a callback function

// All programming logic goes here

3- Opening a request 

Example - xhr.open('GET/POST','url');

4- Sending the request

Example - xhr.send();
